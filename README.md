# MNIST-Tutorial-in-Tensorflow.js ([Live Example]( https://alishdipani.github.io/MNIST-Tutorial-in-Tensorflow.js/ ))
MNIST tutorial in browser using Tensorflow.js, for a live example [click here](https://alishdipani.github.io/MNIST-Tutorial-in-Tensorflow.js/).

## Instructions
1. Load the Dataset.  
2. Visualize a random example.
### Creating a Model  
3. Choose kernel size, number of filters, stride and activation function for a convolutional layer and add it.  
4. Choose number of units and activation function for fully connected layer and add it.  
5. Add the Output layer.  
6. Choose batch size and number of epochs for training and train.
7. Test random example.
### Creating a Model  
3. Load the Model JSON(graph) and weights.
4. Load Model Summary.  
5. Choose batch size and number of epochs for training and train.(Optional)
6. Test random example.

### P.S. -   
a) Loading the dataset is necessary.  
b) Adding output layer is necessary.  
c) Do not close the tensorflow visualization interface which pops up.  
d) The training graphs will be plotted in the visor tab.  
e) If a Model is Loaded, Loading Model summary is necessary.

## TODO
- [x] Add Loading and Saving model.  
- [ ] Add Canvas for drawing a digit and testing the model.  
- [ ] Improve the UI.  
- [ ] Add more flexibility to the model.
